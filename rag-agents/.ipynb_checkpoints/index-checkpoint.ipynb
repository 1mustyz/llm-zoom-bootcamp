    "# Implementing Agentic RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This document outlines the implementation of an Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system that goes beyond traditional knowledge bases to provide comprehensive answers through intelligent search strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** is a powerful AI architecture that combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based approaches to provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comprehensive Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG is an advanced natural language processing framework that enhances large language models by incorporating external knowledge sources through a two-step process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Retrieval Phase**: The system searches through external databases, documents, or knowledge bases to find relevant information related to the user's query\n",
    "2. **Generation Phase**: The language model uses both its pre-trained knowledge and the retrieved information to generate comprehensive, accurate, and contextually appropriate responses\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Benefits:**\n",
    "- **Enhanced Accuracy**: Provides up-to-date information beyond the model's training data\n",
    "- **Reduced Hallucinations**: Grounds responses in factual, retrievable content\n",
    "- **Domain Expertise**: Allows specialization in specific fields through curated knowledge bases\n",
    "- **Transparency**: Can cite sources and provide evidence for claims\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Can be updated with new information without retraining the entire model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are trying to create an agent using RAG, where it can answer questions beyond our knowledge base by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implementing intelligent search strategies\n",
    "- Performing iterative information gathering\n",
    "- Combining multiple sources for comprehensive answers\n",
    "- Providing an interactive chat interface for users\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Our implementation follows a progressive approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Simple RAG Implementation\n",
    "- Basic retrieval from knowledge base\n",
    "- Single-shot question answering\n",
    "- Direct integration with language model\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Agentic RAG Implementation\n",
    "- **Intelligent Decision Making**: The agent decides when to search for more information\n",
    "- **Iterative Search**: Performs multiple search rounds to gather comprehensive context\n",
    "- **Deep Search Capabilities**: Explores topics thoroughly through strategic query generation\n",
    "- **Context Management**: Maintains conversation history and search context\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Chat Agent Integration\n",
    "- **Interactive Interface**: Real-time conversation with users\n",
    "- **Session Management**: Maintains conversation history across interactions\n",
    "- **Command System**: Special commands for history, clearing, and navigation\n",
    "- **Error Handling**: Robust error management and user feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agentic Capabilities\n",
    "- **Autonomous Search**: Automatically determines when additional information is needed\n",
    "- **Query Optimization**: Generates targeted search queries based on context\n",
    "- **Iteration Control**: Manages search depth and prevents infinite loops\n",
    "- **Context Synthesis**: Combines information from multiple sources intelligently\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deep Search Functionality\n",
    "- **Multi-round Retrieval**: Performs several search iterations for comprehensive coverage\n",
    "- **Query Diversification**: Uses different search strategies and keywords\n",
    "- **Relevance Filtering**: Deduplicates and prioritizes search results\n",
    "- **Context Building**: Accumulates relevant information across searches\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chat Integration\n",
    "- **Conversational Memory**: Remembers previous questions and answers\n",
    "- **User Experience**: Intuitive interface with clear feedback\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Can handle both single questions and extended conversations\n",
    "- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features and capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The system consists of three main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Search Engine**: Handles retrieval from knowledge base with boosting and filtering\n",
    "2. **Language Model**: Processes prompts and generates responses (Gemini 2.0 Flash)\n",
    "3. **Agent Controller**: Manages the interaction flow and decision-making process\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of This Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Goes beyond simple keyword matching\n",
    "- **Intelligent Exploration**: Discovers related topics and deeper insights\n",
    "- **User-Friendly**: Provides an intuitive chat interface\n",
    "- **Scalable**: Can be extended with additional knowledge sources\n",
    "- **Maintainable**: Clean separation of concerns and modular design\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation represents a significant advancement over traditional RAG systems by introducing autonomous decision-making and iterative search capabilities, making it particularly suitable for educational and support applications where thorough, accurate responses are essential."

      "\"answer\": \"To run Docker on Gentoo, you'll need to follow these general steps:\\n\\n1.  **Kernel Configuration:** Docker requires specific kernel features. Ensure your kernel is configured to support them.  Common requirements include: namespaces (mount, PID, network, IPC, UTS), cgroups (memory, CPU, cpuset, pid, blkio, devices, freezer, net_cls, net_prio), and a reasonably modern kernel version (4.x or later is recommended).\\n\\n2.  **Install Docker:** Use Gentoo's `emerge` package manager to install Docker. The package is usually named `docker` or `docker-cli` and `containerd` or `docker-engine`.  You might need to unmask the package if it's not in your stable branch (check `/etc/portage/package.accept_keywords`).\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   sudo emerge --ask --noreplace docker\\n   ```\\n\\n3. **Enable and Start the Docker Service:** Use systemd to enable and start the Docker service.\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   sudo systemctl enable docker\\n   sudo systemctl start docker\\n   ```\\n\\n4.  **Optional: Add User to Docker Group:**  To run Docker commands without `sudo`, add your user to the `docker` group.\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   sudo gpasswd -a $USER docker\\n   newgrp docker\\n   ```\\n\\n5.  **Verify Installation:** Run a simple Docker command to verify the installation.\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   docker run hello-world\\n   ```\\n\\n\\n**Detailed Breakdown:**\\n\\n*   **Kernel Configuration (Important!)**\\n    *   Use `genkernel` or manually configure your kernel to include the necessary features.  Pay close attention to the Docker documentation and your kernel configuration. Enable namespaces and cgroups as modules or built-in. Consider using `zgrep <config option> /proc/config.gz` to find current kernel config options.\\n\\n*   **Portage Configuration (If needed):**\\n    *   If `emerge` doesn't find the `docker` package or complains about dependencies, you might need to update your Portage tree (`emerge --sync`) or unmask the package.\\n    *   Check `/etc/portage/package.accept_keywords` to see if the `docker` package is masked.  If it is, add a line like this to unmask it:\\n        ```\\n        >=app-emulation/docker-<version> ~amd64\\n        ```\\n        Replace `<version>` with the actual version number and `amd64` with your architecture. You can also use `**` to unmask all versions.\\n\\n*   **Firewall:** Ensure your firewall allows Docker to function correctly. Docker creates its own network interfaces (e.g., `docker0`) and uses iptables rules to manage container networking.\\n\\n*   **Troubleshooting:**\\n    *   Check the Docker daemon logs (`journalctl -u docker`) for errors if Docker fails to start or run correctly.\\n    *   Ensure the `containerd` service is running.\\n\\nRemember to consult the official Docker documentation and the Gentoo Handbook for the most up-to-date and specific instructions. Gentoo is a very customizable distribution, so the exact steps might vary depending on your system configuration.\",\n",

      "question: How do I use Git / GitHub for this course?\n",
      "answer: After you create a GitHub account, you should clone the course repo to your local machine using the process outlined in this video: Git for Everybody: How to Clone a Repository from GitHub\n",
      "Having this local repository on your computer will make it easy for you to access the instructors’ code and make pull requests (if you want to add your own notes or make changes to the course content).\n",
      "You will probably also create your own repositories that host your notes, versions of your file, to do this. Here is a great tutorial that shows you how to do this: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository\n",
      "Remember to ignore large database, .csv, and .gz files, and other files that should not be saved to a repository. Use .gitignore for this: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/gitignore NEVER store passwords or keys in a git repo (even if that repo is set to private).\n",

      "answer: Yes, this applies if you want to use Airflow or Prefect instead of Mage, AWS or Snowflake instead of GCP products or Tableau instead of Metabase or Google data studio.\n",
      "The course covers 2 alternative data stacks, one using GCP and one using local installation of everything. You can use one of them or use your tool of choice.\n",
      "Should you consider it instead of the one tool you use? That we can’t support you if you choose to use a different stack, also you would need to explain the different choices of tool for the peer review of your capstone project.\n",

      "section: General course-related questions\n",
      "question: Certificate - Can I follow the course in a self-paced mode and get a certificate?\n",
      "answer: No, you can only get a certificate if you finish the course with a “live” cohort. We don't award certificates for the self-paced mode. The reason is you need to peer-review capstone(s) after submitting a project. You can only peer-review projects at the time the course is running.\n",

      "section: General course-related questions\n",
      "question: Course - Can I follow the course after it finishes?\n",
      "answer: Yes, we will keep all the materials after the course finishes, so you can follow the course at your own pace after it finishes.\n",

      "import findspark\n",
      "findspark.init()\n",

      "Another possible solution is:\n",
      "Check that pyspark is pointing to the correct location.\n",
      "Run pyspark.__file__. It should be list /home/<your user name>/spark/spark-3.0.3-bin-hadoop3.2/python/pyspark/__init__.py if you followed the videos.\n",
      "If it is pointing to your python site-packages remove the pyspark directory there and check that you have added the correct exports to you .bashrc file and that there are not any other exports which might supersede the ones provided in the course content.\n",
      "To add to the solution above, if the errors persist in regards to setting the correct path for spark,  an alternative solution for permanent path setting solve the error is  to set environment variables on system and user environment variables following this tutorial: Install Apache PySpark on Windows PC | Apache Spark Installation Guide\n",
      "Once everything is installed, skip to 7:14 to set up environment variables. This allows for the environment variables to be set permanently.\n",

      "💡 Answer: Based on my knowledge, Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that allows you to define and provision infrastructure using a declarative configuration language. It enables you to manage and automate your infrastructure across various cloud providers and on-premises environments. Terraform uses configuration files to describe the desired state of your infrastructure, and it automatically provisions and manages the resources to match that state. It simplifies infrastructure management by treating infrastructure as code, enabling version control, collaboration, and automation.\n",
